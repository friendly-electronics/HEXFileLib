**HEXFileLib** is a library for reading and writing Intel HEX files from C# programs. Intel HEX file format allows storing binary data in ASCII text form and became a de-facto standard for saving microcontroller programs and EEPROM and other memory chips data. The library is mainly intended for C# developers who want to parse or create firmware for AVR, PIC, STM32 and other types of microcontrollers or embedded systems like Arduino and Raspberry PI.
